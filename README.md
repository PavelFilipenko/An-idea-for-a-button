# An-idea-for-a-button
I recently came across the idea of drop-down buttons on Pinterest. And I decided to implement it. I set myself a minimum of CSS and a maximum of JavaScript.

Update 2.05.2022. When you click the button, the text of the button changes to the logo.

Update 8.05.2022. When you click on the button there are 5 smaller buttons with links to the corresponding sites.
